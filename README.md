# Neural-Network-HAPI-Project
Utilizing Neural Networks through torch to model absorption coefficient as a function of wavenumber. Atmospheric data taken from the HITRAN database using the HAPI API, overall results is a function that will give you the greatest absorption coefficient of any relevant wavenumber in the dataset
